# Dependencies
* Python 3  
* Pytorch 0.4.1   

# Network Structure
LDFNet adopts two distinctive sub-networks in a parallel manner to process multiple information.  
Also, LDFNet employs the luminance information to assist the processing of the depth information in the D&Y encoder.

# Evaluation
LDFNet achieves a mIoU scores of **71.3 %** on the Cityscapes dataset without any pretrained model.[[Benchmarks]](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/benchmarks/)  
For the resolution 512x1024 input, LDFNet can run at the speed of **18.4** and **27.7**FPS on a singel Titan X and GTX 1080 Ti, respectively.  

# Implementation:
Flow the steps presented below:
* Download "train" and "model" files.  
* Create your own global file and put "train" and "model" in it.
* Set the global file path in the very bottom of "main.py" in "train" file.  
* Create "save" file in your global file, and the trained model and the validation results will be saved in the file you specify.
